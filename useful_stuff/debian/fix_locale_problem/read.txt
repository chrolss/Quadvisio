First

	sudo apt-get install locales

In most cases it will report that locales is already installed and up to date.

Second, what most how-to’s and fixes forget to mention, it is very important 
to know which locales are needed by the system.

	sudo locale

By running this command, you will get a list of every needed locale. It is important to write down the locales other than en_US. On my system there was an extra locale nl_NL.UTF-8.

Now, you have to check which locale is already present on the system. Do this by running the following listing.

	sudo locale -a

Normally you will see some English locales. But your extra locales are probably missing.

Use dpkg-reconfigure

	sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales

First you’ll get a menu in which you have to select all needed locales. Select the English ones AND your extras with the space-bar.
In the next window select en_US.UTF-8 as default locale.
After regenerating the locales log out and back in. Your problem is solved!
